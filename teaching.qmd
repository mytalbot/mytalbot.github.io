## Curricular Courses at MHH

At Hannover Medical School, I regularly offer two courses for staff and students (approximately every six months):

| Course | Description | Language |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Basic Statistics | Fundamentals of statistics for laboratory animal science | German/English |
| Experimental Design | Power analysis and preparation of animal experiment applications | German/English |

Current dates and registration are available through the internal [course catalogue (in German)](https://www.mhh.de/tierlabor/lehr-und-sachkundeveranstaltungen/curriculare-lehre-aufbaumodule).

## Custom Training

Looking for a course tailored to your research group or institution? I'm happy to develop workshops that address your specific needs, whether that's a half-day introduction or a multi-day intensive training.

[Contact me](mailto:info@talbot-science.de){.btn .btn-primary} to discuss your requirements.

## Software Requirements
Most statistics courses use **GraphPad Prism** for accessibility. Participants need a valid license or can use the [30-day trial version](https://www.graphpad.com/demos/). R-based courses require a working R/RStudio installation.
