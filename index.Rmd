## Steven R. Talbot
### Data Scientist

Ever since I got into Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence, unraveling the secrets buried in massive piles of biomedical data has been my ultimate driving force.

I'm a **Data Scientist** (and Biochemist) at the Institute for [Laboratory Animal Science](https://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?id=219&L=1) within the [Hannover Medical School (Germany)](https://www.mh-hannover.de/index.php?&L=1), with my primary focus being on developing mathematical models for [Severity Assessment](https://severity-assessment.de/) in laboratory animals. In addition, I actively utilize my computational expertise to support the 3R principle by contributing to the [R2N](https://r2n.eu/) network. 


In 2023, I was appointed as a **principal investigator** and group leader for a 3R research consortium that focuses on developing [micro replacement methods and fluidic systems](https://www.3r-forschung.de/) to replace laboratory animals. This exciting project is generously funded by ["zukunft.niedersachsen"](https://www.mwk.niedersachsen.de/zukunft.niedersachsen/agenda-zukunft-niedersachsen-219437.html). I am also a co-author of the statistics and experimental design sections of the current [Pschyrembel 2023](https://www.pschyrembel.de/), and author, creator and maintainer of several R-packages (e.g., [RELSA](https://talbotsr.com/RELSA/index.html)).


As an enthusiastic R user and avid gravel biker, I am dedicated to both my professional and personal pursuits. Nevertheless, I must confess that I possess an unwavering fondness for pizza...
