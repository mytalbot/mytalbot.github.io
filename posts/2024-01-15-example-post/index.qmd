## Introduction

This is an example blog post. You can delete this once you've created your own posts.

## How to Create a New Blog Post

1. Create a new folder in `posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title/`
2. Create an `index.qmd` file inside that folder
3. Add the YAML header (see below)
4. Write your content in Markdown

### YAML Header Template

```yaml
---
title: "Your Post Title"
description: "A brief description for the listing page"
date: "2024-01-15"
categories: [category1, category2]
image: "thumbnail.png"
draft: false
---
```

## Including Code

You can include R or Python code that gets executed:

```{r}
#| label: example-r
#| echo: true

# Example R code
data <- data.frame(
  x = 1:10,
  y = rnorm(10)
)
summary(data)
```

Or Python:

```{python}
#| label: example-python
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

# Example Python code
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'x': range(1, 11),
    'y': np.random.randn(10)
})
print(df.describe())
```

## Including Images

Place images in the same folder as your post and reference them:

```markdown
![Image caption](image-name.png)
```

## Categories

Use categories to organize your posts. Suggested categories:

- `papers` - Discussions of interesting papers
- `code` - Code tutorials and snippets
- `methods` - Statistical and ML methods
- `tools` - Tool announcements and tutorials
- `thoughts` - General thoughts and opinions

## Draft Mode

Set `draft: true` in the YAML header to hide a post from the listing while you work on it. Change to `draft: false` when ready to publish.
