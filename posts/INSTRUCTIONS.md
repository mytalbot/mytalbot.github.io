Prompt Template for Blog Posts:

  Write a blog post for my website about the problem of a fixed 20% threshold for body weight change in
  animal models.

  Style guidelines:
  - Popular science ("populärwissenschaftlich") for a broad audience
  - No code blocks or technical tutorials
  - Narrative, engaging writing with a clear message
  - Focus on the "why" and societal/ethical relevance, not the "how"
  - Use accessible analogies to explain complex concepts
  - 3R/animal welfare angle where applicable

  Structure:
  - Compelling question or hook as title
  - Opening that establishes relevance and context
  - Problem statement (what challenge does this address?)
  - Solution/approach explanation in accessible terms
  - Broader implications (why does this matter?)
  - Closing with forward-looking perspective
  - Resources/links section at the end (no formal references list)

  Format:
  - 1-2 image placeholders with captions (I'll add images later)
  - Justified text (Blocksatz)
  - Categories: [suggest relevant ones]
  - Draft mode: true/false

  Here is a general template for the post:
  /Users/steven/Documents/MHH\ Bleich/Websites/Personal\
  Website/posts/2024-01-15-example-post/index.qmd  

  use this image in the post folder: endpoint_overview.png to illustrate the basic concept.
  I'll provide another image with body weight change courses in DSS-colitis and sepsis for a single animal each to
  illustrate the difference.
