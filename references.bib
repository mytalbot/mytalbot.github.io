	abstract={Preference tests help to determine how highly individuals value different options to choose from. During preference testing, two or more options are presented simultaneously, and options are ranked based on the choices made. Presented options, however, influence each other, where the amount of influence increases with the number of options. Multiple binary choice tests can reduce this degree of influence, but conventional analysis methods do not reveal the relative strengths of preference, i.e., the preference difference between options. Here, we demonstrate that multiple binary comparisons can be used not only to rank but also to scale preferences among many options (i.e., their worth value). We analyzed human image preference data with known valence scores to develop and validate our approach to determine how known valence ranges (high vs. low) converge on a scaled representation of preference data. Our approach allowed us to assess the valence of ranked options in mice and rhesus macaques. By conducting simulations, we developed an approach to incorporate additional option choices into existing rank orders without the need to conduct binary choice tests with all original options, thus reducing the number of animal experiments needed. Two quality measures, consensus error and intransitivity ratio, allow for assessing the achieved confidence of the scaled ranking and better tailoring of measurements required to improve it further. The software is available as an R package (“simsalRbim”). Our approach optimizes preference testing, e.g., in welfare assessment, and allows us to efficiently and quantitatively assess the relative value of options presented to animals.},

	abstract={Accurate and standardized methods for assessing the vital status of patients are crucial for patient care and scientific research. This study introduces the Patient Vital Status (PVS), which quantifies and contextualizes a patient's physical status based on continuous variables such as vital signs and deviations from age-dependent normative values. The vital signs, heart rate, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, mean arterial blood pressure, and temperature were selected as input to the PVS pipeline. The method was applied to 70 pediatric patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), and its efficacy was evaluated by matching high values with septic events at different time points in patient care. Septic events included systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected or proven sepsis. The comparison of maximum PVS values between the presence and absence of a septic event showed significant differences (SIRS/No SIRS: p < 0.0001, η(2) = 0.54; Suspected Sepsis/No Suspected Sepsis: p = 0.00047, η(2) = 0.43; Proven Sepsis/No Proven Sepsis: p = 0.0055, η(2) = 0.34). A further comparison between the most severe PVS in septic patients with the PVS at ICU discharge showed even higher effect sizes (SIRS: p < 0.0001, η(2) = 0.8; Suspected Sepsis: p < 0.0001, η(2) = 0.8; Proven Sepsis: p = 0.002, η(2) = 0.84). The PVS is emerging as a data-driven tool with the potential to assess a patient's vital status in the ICU objectively. Despite real-world data challenges and potential annotation biases, it shows promise for monitoring disease progression and treatment responses. Its adaptability to different disease markers and reliance on age-dependent reference values further broaden its application possibilities. Real-time implementation of PVS in personalized patient monitoring may be a promising way to improve critical care. However, PVS requires further research and external validation to realize its true potential.},

	abstract={NSG mice are among the most immunodeficient mouse model being used in various scientific branches. In diabetelogical research diabetic NSG mice are an important asset as a xenotransplantation model for human pancreatic islets or pluripotent stem cell-derived islets. The treatment with the beta cell toxin streptozotocin is the standard procedure for triggering a chemically induced diabetes. Surprisingly, little data has been published about the reproducibility, stress and animal suffering in these NSG mice during diabetes induction. The 3R rules, however, are a constant reminder that existing methods can be further refined to minimize suffering. In this pilot study the dose–response relationship of STZ in male NSG mice was investigated and additionally animal suffering was charted by applying the novel ‘Relative Severity Assessment’ algorithm. By this we successfully explored an STZ dose that reliably induced diabetes while reduced stress and pain to the animals to a minimum using evidence-based and objective parameters rather than criteria that might be influenced by human bias.},

	number={1},
	pages={2605},
	note={ID: Talbot2023},
	abstract={The fundament of an evidence-based severity assessment in laboratory animal science is reliable distress parameters. Many readouts are used to evaluate and determine animal distress and the severity of experimental procedures. Therefore, we analyzed four distinct parameters like the body weight, burrowing behavior, nesting, and distress score in the four gastrointestinal animal models (pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), pancreatitis, CCl4 intoxication, and bile duct ligation (BDL)). Further, we determined the parameters’ robustness in various experimental subgroups due to slight variations like drug treatment or telemeter implantations. We used non-parametric bootstrapping to get robust estimates and 95\% confidence intervals for the experimental groups. It was found that the performance of the readout parameters is model-dependent and that the distress score is prone to experimental variation. On the other hand, we also found that burrowing and nesting can be more robust than, e.g., the body weight when evaluating PDA. However, the body weight still was highly robust in BDL, pancreatitis, and CCl4 intoxication. To address the complex nature of the multi-dimensional severity space, we used the Relative Severity Assessment (RELSA) procedure to combine multiple distress parameters into a score and mapped the subgroups and models against a defined reference set obtained by telemeter implantation. This approach allowed us to compare the severity of individual animals in the experimental subgroups using the maximum achieved severity (RELSAmax). With this, the following order of severity was found for the animal models: CCl4 < PDA ≈ Pancreatitis < BDL. Furthermore, the robustness of the RELSA procedure and outcome was externally validated with a reference set from another laboratory also obtained from telemeter implantation. Since the RELSA procedure reflects the multi-dimensional severity information and is highly robust in estimating the quantitative severity within and between models, it can be deemed a valuable tool for laboratory animal severity assessment.},

	abstract={In animal-based research, welfare assessments are essential for ethical and legal reasons. However, accurate assessment of suffering in laboratory animals is often complicated by the multidimensional character of distress and pain and the associated affective states. The present study aimed to design and validate multidimensional composite measure schemes comprising behavioral and biochemical parameters based on a bioinformatics approach. Published data sets from induced and genetic mouse models of neurological and psychiatric disorders were subjected to a bioinformatics workflow for cross-model analyses. ROC analyses pointed to a model-specific discriminatory power of selected behavioral parameters. Principal component analyses confirmed that the composite measure schemes developed for adult or young mice provided relevant information with the level of group separation reflecting the expected severity levels. Finally, the validity of the composite measure schemes developed for adult and young mice was further confirmed by k-means-based clustering as a basis for severity classification. The classification systems allowed the allocation of individual animals to different severity levels and a direct comparison of animal groups and other models. In conclusion, the bioinformatics approach confirmed the suitability of the composite measure schemes for evidence-based comparative severity assessment in adult and young mice. In particular, we demonstrated that the composite measure schemes provide a basis for an individualized severity classification in control and experimental groups allowing direct comparison of severity levels across different induced or genetic models. An online tool (R package) is provided, allowing the application of the bioinformatics approach to severity assessment data sets regardless of the parameters or models used. This tool can also be used to validate refinement measures.},

	abstract={Abstract Characteristic properties of samples can be measured by spectrometers, cameras or other applicable equipment. To achieve meaningful classification results with a user-friendly arrangement of the overall system, a new approach is pursued in which principally unaltered input data are reduced to their essential content using a Wavelet transform and are refined with a special smoothing method in such a manner that certain dimension-reducing techniques can also be employed in a numerically stable way for discontinuous data sets as they occur, for example, in classification tasks. The introduced multivariate adaptive embedding (MAE) process acts as a universal approximator in the adaptation phase, to a very large extent without iterations and parameter adjustments, and deduces a redundancy-free model with which untrained input data with outstanding generalization properties, in terms of an application, can be processed in the application phase. While taking advantage of the proximity relationships of the data points, the entire information is mapped into a low-dimensional coordinate system using a supervised learning process and is scaled and adapted to the respective application using an unsupervised learning process. This approach allows classification of highly related and confused data as they may occur in identification/classification setups for bacteria and other substances using spectroscopic methods.},

	abstract={Infection generates localized hypoxia in affected tissue, inducing cellular survival responses and modulating inflammatory processes. Consideration of oxygen status as a parameter in in vitro infection research is therefore vital to the generation of physiologically relevant data within the 3R context. In this study, we characterize the culture morphology and oxygenation of liquid-liquid interface (LLI) permanent bronchial epithelial (Calu-3), classical air-liquid interface (cALI) Calu-3, and cALI human primary bronchial epithelial cell (hBEC) models under the normoxic conditions within standard incubators, commonly employed in in vitro work. We compare the normoxic state of these models to their hypoxic state to assess changes in the airway epithelial environment in response to oxygen deprivation, and the extent to which select hypoxia responses can be observed at the molecular level. Additional juxtapositions are drawn between Calu-3 LLI and cALI models and Calu-3 conventional monolayer (CM) and inverted air-liquid interface (iALI) models, due to their relevance for basic and specialized research, respectively. Epithelial complexity was observed to vary amongst the filter-based models, and all models were found to exhibit characteristic extracellular oxygen depletion patterns under normoxia. Importantly, the extracellular oxygen contents of Calu-3 LLI, cALI, and CM models significantly decreased during normoxic incubation. Specific hypoxia responses through stabilization of HIF-1α, HIF-2α, and/or HIF-3α and alteration of ACE2 protein levels differed in response to both culture format and cell type. Therefore, while all models examined provide valuable opportunities for in vitro exploration, variation in their morphological, physiological, and molecular characteristics necessitates careful consideration during experimental design.},

	abstract={AbstractOncolytic viruses (OV) expressing bispecific T-cell engagers (BiTEs) are promising tools for tumor immunotherapy but the range of target tumors is limited. To facilitate effective T-cell stimulation with broad-range applicability, we established membrane-associated T-cell engagers (MATEs) harboring the protein transduction domain of the HIV-Tat protein to achieve non-selective binding to target cells. In vitro, MATEs effectively activated murine T cells and improved killing of MC38 colon carcinoma cells. Similarly, humanized MATEs activated T cells in PBMCs from human donors. In MC38-tumors in mice, MATE-expression by the oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/11 facilitated intratumoral T-cell activation, reduced tumor growth and prolonged survival accompanied by infiltration of tumor-directed CD8+ T cells and improved CD8/CD4 T-cell ratio. Absence of early T-cell activation in tumor draining lymph nodes suggests the safe applicability of this strategy. Furthermore, MATE-expression by Ad5/11 was capable of breaking resistance to αPD-1 checkpoint therapy thereby promoting T-cell/tumor cell proximity and clustering of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. In summary, we demonstrated that MATE expressing OVs are powerful T-cell activating tools suitable for local immunotherapy of a broad range of tumors.},

	abstract={BackgroundStimulated by retinoic acid gene 6 (STRA6) is a cell surface receptor that regulates cellular uptake of vitamin A metabolites and cardiac development. We hypothesized that Stra6 expression attenuates ischemic injury-induced heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI) by vitamin A-dependent mechanisms.MethodsMI was induced in mice with Stra6 germline deletion, vitamin A deficiency (VitAD) by combined lecithin-retinol acyltransferase (Lrat) germline deletion and feeding with a vitamin A-deficient diet. Contractile function was determined by transthoracic echocardiography, cardiac structure was assessed by histological analysis, and gene profiling was performed by RNA sequencing.ResultsStra6 deletion and VitAD did not impact contractile function and cardiac structure under basal conditions. Stra6 deficiency resulted in myocardial rupture, with the majority of mice dying by 4 days post-MI, which additional VitAD attenuated. Interestingly, contractile function, mRNA expression of heart failure markers, and cardiac structure were not different between groups 3 days post-MI.

	journal={Lab animal},
	note={ID: Schreiber2025},
	abstract={Despite ongoing research, realistic in vitro models for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) that can mimic the complex pathology are still not available, highlighting the need for continuous animal-based investigation. As part of the 3R principles, constant refinement of animal experiments is mandatory. Therefore, reviewing the effectiveness of used analgesics is essential for animal model-specific refinement. Here we evaluate whether metamizole—previously used in our institute—or tramadol is more suitable as on-demand analgesia in mouse models of ALL. The murine orthotopic xenograft models were induced by intravenous injection of either the human precursor ALL cell lines RS4;11 or SEM into immune-deficient male and female NSG mice. Mice were weighed and checked daily for basic behavior and well-being, while detailed welfare parameters, such as burrowing behavior, nesting activity, perianal temperature, liquid intake, fecal corticosterone metabolites, mouse grimace scale and tumor cell proliferation were monitored weekly. Upon leukemic progression, when signs of pain or discomfort were observed, metamizole (3 mg/ml) or tramadol (1 mg/ml) was administered via drinking water for analgesic treatment, and detailed welfare parameters were assessed daily. Following the initiation of treatment, mice receiving either metamizole or tramadol continued to show a decline in body weight, liquid intake and other welfare parameters, suggesting that neither drug was sufficient to fully counteract the effects of late-stage ALL. Combining the data with the relative severity assessment algorithm revealed that metamizole treatment appeared less effective than tramadol in mitigating the detrimental effects of the disease. Therefore, the opioid tramadol should replace metamizole as the analgesic compound of choice for hematological xenograft models to improve animal welfare in future studies.},

	abstract={ObjectivesStroke is a severe complication in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVAD), significantly affecting quality of life and potentially leading to death. This study aimed to illustrate the clinical features, outcomes, and risk factors associated with stroke in LVAD patients, with the goal of identifying potential treatment targets.MethodsIn a study of 249 consecutive patients who underwent LVAD implantation, detailed evaluations were conducted regarding clinical characteristics, perioperative management, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and brain imaging. The etiology, treatment, and outcomes were subsequently assessed in individuals who encountered a stroke.ResultsEighty-three cerebrovascular events (CVE) occurred in 54/249 patients during a median study period of 2.2 years (0.4–3.5) with 53 ischemic events and 22 intracranial hemorrhages (ICH). Early peri- or postoperatively CVE in context to the LVAD implantation were identified in 31 patients. Competing risks regression analysis revealed that postoperative dialysis was associated with higher risk for CVE, considering death as competing risk event (HR 3.617; 95\%-CI: 1.78–7.35; p ≤ 0.001). Modified Rankin Scale at outpatient visit did not differ in early CVE 3 (IQR 2–5) vs. 3 (IQR2–4), p = 0.146]. Late CVE frequently occurred during hospitalization for sepsis or in cardiac rehabilitation n = 16/41 events (39\%)]. Competing risk analysis treating death and heart transplantation as competitors identified history of stroke as associated factor HR 3.564; 95\%-CI (1.67–7.169); p = 0.001]. Mortality was not associated with CVE with n = 27/54 (50\%) vs. without CVE 94/195 (48.2\%) p = 0.183].ConclusionPatients who require postoperative dialysis face a heightened risk for early cerebrovascular events (CVE) during and after LVAD implantation. Additionally, a history of stroke and complicated clinical courses should increase awareness regarding the potential for impending CVE in the long term.},

	abstract={Abstract Anti-CD19 CAR NK cells may provide a promising non-HLA-restricted immune cell product and have been clinically studied primarily on low-grade B-cell lymphoma patients. We used retroviral gene transfer to generate aCD19 CAR NK cells from the peripheral blood of healthy volunteers. We evaluated their efficacy in B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cells in vitro and in vivo. aCD19 CAR NK cells showed potent specific cytotoxicity against eleven BCP-ALL PDX models in vitro. When used as monotherapy in vivo, they provided a survival benefit, albeit complete remissions were not achieved. Due to the low accumulation of aCD19 CAR NK cells in the bone marrow, we used targeted pharmacotherapy based on venetoclax, dexamethasone, and dasatinib to induce remission in BCR-ABL-positive ALL and combined it with aCD19 NK cell therapy for consolidation. Overlapping therapy enhanced aCD19 CAR NK cell cytotoxicity in vitro and significantly prolonged survival in two high-risk BCP-ALL PDX models with individual long-term remissions. Relapse cells showed no signs of therapy-induced evolution as CD19 expression, sensitivity to venetoclax, and aCD19 CAR cell cytotoxicity remained unchanged. These data demonstrate the potential of aCD19 CAR NK cells as a component of combinatorial therapy for BCP-ALL, which should be further evaluated in clinical trials.},

	abstract={OBJECTIVES: Chronic liver diseases (CLDs) have diverse etiologies. To better classify CLDs, we explored the ability of longitudinal multiparametric MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) in depicting alterations in liver morphology, inflammation, and hepatocyte and macrophage activity in murine high-fat diet (HFD)- and carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 )-induced CLD models. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mice were either untreated, fed an HFD for 24 weeks, or injected with CCl 4 for 8 weeks. Longitudinal multiparametric MRI was performed every 4 weeks using a 7 T MRI scanner, including T1/T2 relaxometry, morphological T1/T2-weighted imaging, and fat-selective imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging was applied to assess fibrotic remodeling and T1-weighted and T2*-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI using gadoxetic acid and ferucarbotran to target hepatocytes and the mononuclear phagocyte system, respectively. Imaging data were associated with histopathological and serological analyses. Principal component analysis and clustering were used to reveal underlying disease patterns. RESULTS: The MRI parameters significantly correlated with histologically confirmed steatosis, fibrosis, and liver damage, with varying importance. No single MRI parameter exclusively correlated with 1 pathophysiological feature, underscoring the necessity for using parameter patterns. Clustering revealed early-stage, model-specific patterns. Although the HFD model exhibited pronounced liver fat content and fibrosis, the CCl 4 model indicated reduced liver fat content and impaired hepatocyte and macrophage function. In both models, MRI biomarkers of inflammation were elevated. CONCLUSIONS: Multiparametric MRI patterns can be assigned to pathophysiological processes and used for murine CLD classification and progression tracking. These MRI biomarker patterns can directly be explored clinically to improve early CLD detection and differentiation and to refine treatments.},

	journal={Biomedicines},
	volume={12},
	number={2},
	abstract={In the healthcare system, lower leg fractures remain relevant, incurring costs related to surgical treatment, hospitalization, and rehabilitation. The duration of treatment may vary depending on the individual case and its severity. Casting as a post-surgical fracture treatment is a common method in human and experimental veterinary medicine. Despite the high importance of sheep in preclinical testing materials for osteosynthesis, there is no standardised cast system ensuring proper stabilisation and functionality of hind limbs during the healing of tibia fractures or defects. Existing treatment approaches for tibial osteosynthesis in laboratory animal science include sling hanging, external fixators, or former Achilles tendon incision. These methods restrict animal movement for 4â€“6 weeks, limit species-typical behaviour, and impact social interactions. Our pilot study introduces a Standardised Walking Cast (SWC) for sheep, enabling immediate physiological movement post surgery. Seven Rhone sheep (female, 63.5 kg ± 6.45 kg) each with a single tibia defect (6 mm mechanical drilled defect) underwent SWC application for 4 weeks after plate osteosynthesis. The animals bore weight on their operated leg from day one, exhibiting slight lameness (grade 1â€“2 out of 5). Individual step lengths showed good uniformity (average deviation: 0.89 cm). Group housing successfully started on day three after surgery. Weekly X-rays and cast changes ensured proper placement, depicting the healing process. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an SWC for up to 72 kg of body weight without sling hanging via ceiling mounting or external fixation techniques. Allowing species-typical movement and social behaviour can significantly improve the physiological behaviour of sheep in experiments, contributing to refinement.},

	abstract={BackgroundCanine cognitive dysfunction (CCD) is a common, yet underdiagnosed neurodegenerative disease affecting older dogs. Treatment is most effective when started early, so identifying mild cognitive decline in the earlier stages of the disease is considered important.Hypothesis/objectiveTo compare the results of three different standard screening questionnaires Canine Dementia Scale (CADES), Canine Cognitive Assessment Scale (CCAS), and Canine Cognitive Dysfunction Rating Scale (CCDR)] for CCD diagnosis. Trainability, pain sensitivity, and fear were additionally assessed with the Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire (C-BARQ) in order to evaluate associations between the three dementia scales and behavior.MethodsAn online survey containing all the mentioned questionnaires was designed for and distributed among owners of elderly dogs.ResultsData from 597 dogs were analyzed. Overall, the scores of the three CCD questionnaires correlated well with each other, especially those of the CADES and CCAS. The CADES was more sensitive in identifying dogs with already mild to moderate cognitive impairment, while the others classified them as still undergoing normal aging. CCD scores increased for all questionnaires with age with spatial orientation being a key feature in CCD development. Trainability assessed with the C-BARQ decreased significantly with severity of CCD signs, while pain sensitivity increased. Fear and anxiety was pronounced in animals with mild but not with severe CCD. These associations based on the C-BARQ were more clearly observable in relation to CADES and CCDR than CCAS.Conclusion/clinical relevanceThe choice of screening questionnaire impacts the evaluation of cognitive status and severity of CCD. Thresholds for severity classification differ significantly and may have an impact on reliable assessment. Further longitudinal studies are required to determine which of the questionnaires investigated in this study is best suited for early detection of CCD.},

Animal experiments must be performed in accordance with the 3R principles of replacement and reduction, if possible, and refinement where these procedures remain crucial. In addition, European Union legislations demand a continuous refinement approach, as well as pro- and retrospective severity assessment. In this study, an objective databased severity assessment was performed in murine models for pancreatic cancer induced by orthotopic, subcutaneous, or intravenous injection of Panc02 cells. Parameters such as body weight change, distress score, perianal temperature, mouse grimace scale, burrowing, nesting behavior, and the concentration of corticosterone in plasma and its metabolites in feces were monitored during tumor progression. The most important parameters were combined into a score and mapped against a reference data set by the Relative Severity Assessment procedure (RELSA) to obtain the maximum achieved severity for each animal (RELSAmax). This scoring revealed a significantly higher RELSAmax for the orthotopic model than for the subcutaneous and intravenous models. However, compared to animal models such as pancreatitis and bile duct ligation, the pancreatic cancer models are shown to be less severe. Data-based animal welfare assessment proved to be a valuable tool for comparing the severity of differently induced cancer models.},

	note={ID: Munk2024},
	abstract={While neurosurgical interventions are frequently used in laboratory mice, refinement efforts to optimize analgesic management based on multimodal approaches appear to be rather limited. Therefore, we compared the efficacy and tolerability of combinations of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug carprofen, a sustained-release formulation of the opioid buprenorphine, and the local anesthetic bupivacaine with carprofen monotherapy. Female and male C57BL/6J mice were subjected to isoflurane anesthesia and an intracranial electrode implant procedure. Given the multidimensional nature of postsurgical pain and distress, various physiological, behavioral, and biochemical parameters were applied for their assessment. The analysis revealed alterations in Neuro scores, home cage locomotion, body weight, nest building, mouse grimace scales, and fecal corticosterone metabolites. A composite measure scheme allowed the allocation of individual mice to severity classes. The comparison between groups failed to indicate the superiority of multimodal regimens over high-dose NSAID monotherapy. In conclusion, our findings confirmed the informative value of various parameters for assessment of pain and distress following neurosurgical procedures in mice. While all drug regimens were well tolerated in control mice, our data suggest that the total drug load should be carefully considered for perioperative management. Future studies would be of interest to assess potential synergies of drug combinations with lower doses of carprofen.},

	number={20},
	abstract={Background: Humanized mice transplanted with CD34+ hematopoietic cells (HPCs) are broadly used to study human immune responses and infections in vivo and for testing therapies pre-clinically. However, until now, it was not clear whether interactions between the mouse major histocompatibility complexes (MHCs) and/or the human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) were necessary for human T-cell development and immune reactivity. Methods: We evaluated the long-term (20-week) human hematopoiesis and human T-cell development in NOD Scid Gamma (NSG) mice lacking the expression of MHC class I and II (NSG-DKO). Triplicate experiments were performed with HPCs obtained from three donors, and humanization was confirmed in the reference strain NOD Rag Gamma (NRG). Further, we tested whether humanized NSG-DKO mice would respond to a lentiviral vector (LV) systemic delivery of HLA-A*02:01, HLA-DRB1*04:01, human GM-CSF/IFN-α, and the human cytomegalovirus gB antigen. Results: Human immune reconstitution was detectable in peripheral blood from 8 to 20 weeks after the transplantation of NSG-DKO. Human single positive CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells were detectable in lymphatic tissues (thymus, bone marrow, and spleen). LV delivery harnessed the detection of lymphocyte subsets in bone marrow (αβ and γδ T-cells and NK cells) and the expression of HLA-DR. Furthermore, RNA sequencing showed that LV delivery increased the expression of different human reactome pathways, such as defense responses to other organisms and viruses. Conclusions: Human T-cell development and reactivity are independent of the expression of murine MHCs in humanized mice. Therefore, humanized NSG-DKO is a promising new model for studying human immune responses, as it abrogates the xenograft mouse MHC interference.},

This multicentre study aimed to assess the robustness of Irwin tests across multinational sites during three stages of protocol harmonisation. The projects were part of the Enhanced Quality in Preclinical Data framework, aiming to increase success rates in transition from preclinical testing to clinical application. Experimental Approach Female and male NMRI mice were assigned to one of three groups (vehicle, MK-801 0.1 and 0.3 mg?kg?1). Irwin scores were assessed at baseline and multiple times following intraperitoneal injection of MK-801 using local protocols (Stage 1), shared protocols with harmonised environmental design (Stage 2) and fully harmonised Irwin scoring protocols (Stage 3). Key Results The analysis based on the four functional domains (motor, autonomic, sedation and excitation) revealed substantial data variability in Stages 1 and 2. Although there was still marked overall heterogeneity between sites in Stage 3 after complete harmonisation of the Irwin scoring scheme, heterogeneity was only moderate within functional domains. When comparing treatment groups versus vehicle, we found large effect sizes in the motor domain and subtle to moderate effects in the excitation-related and autonomic domains. Conclusion and Implications The pronounced interlaboratory variability in Irwin datasets for the CNS-active compound MK-801 needs to be carefully considered when making decisions during drug development. While environmental and general study design had a minor impact, the study suggests that harmonisation of parameters and their scoring can limit variability and increase robustness.},

	abstract={The forced swim test (FST) is a traditional assay, which has been used for more than 40 years to assess antidepressant effects of novel drug candidates. In recent years, a debate about the test has focused on the assumption that the FST is highly aversive and burdening for the animals because of the earlier anthropomorphic interpretation and designation as a "behavioral despair test". The Directive 2010/63/EU and the German Animal Welfare law require a prospective severity classification of the planned experimental procedures. Still, an objective examination of the animals’ burden in this test has not been performed yet. To fill this gap, we conducted an evidence-based severity assessment of the forced swim test in rats according to a ’standard protocol’ with a water temperature of 25°C. We examined parameters representing the physiological and the affective state, and natural as well as locomotion-associated behaviors in three separate experiments to reflect as many dimensions as possible of the animal’s condition in the test. Hypothermia was the only effect observed in all animals exposed to the FST when using this standard protocol. Additional adverse effects on body weight, food consumption, and fecal corticosterone metabolite concentrations occurred in response to administration of the antidepressant imipramine, which is frequently used as positive control when testing for antidepressant effects of new substances. We conclude that this version of the FST itself is less severe for the animals than assumed, and we suggest a severity classification of ’moderate’ because of the acute and short-lasting effects of hypothermia. To refine the FST according to the 3Rs, we encourage confirming the predictive validity in warmer water temperatures to allow the rats to maintain physiological body temperature.},

	abstract={Evaluating stress in laboratory animals is a key principle in animal welfare. Measuring corticosterone is a common method to assess stress in laboratory mice. There are, however, numerous methods to measure glucocorticoids with differences in sample matrix (e.g., plasma, urine) and quantification techniques (e.g., enzyme immunoassay or radioimmunoassay). Here, the authors present a mapping review and a searchable database, giving a complete overview of all studies mea­suring endogenous corticosterone in mice up to February 2018. For each study, information was recorded regarding mouse strain and sex; corticosterone sample matrix and quantification technique; and whether the study covered the research theme animal welfare, neuroscience, stress, inflammation, or pain (the themes of specific interest in our con­sortium). Using all database entries for the year 2012, an exploratory meta-regression was performed to determine the effect of predictors on basal corticosterone concentrations. Seventy-five studies were included using the predictors sex, time-since-lights-on, sample matrix, quantification technique, age of the mice, and type of control. Sex, time-since-lights-on, and type of control significantly affected basal corticosterone concentrations. The resulting database can be used, inter alia, for preventing unnecessary duplication of experiments, identifying knowledge gaps, and standardizing or heterogenizing methodologies. These results will help plan more efficient and valid experiments in the future and can answer new questions in silico using meta-analyses.},

	abstract={This study assessed the postoperative severity after three different visceral surgical interventions in rats by using objective parameters pertaining to various disciplines. The objective was to evaluate whether the degree of severity increases with the invasiveness of the intervention and whether this is in accordance with the EU Directive 2010/63. 136 adult male WistarHan rats were assigned to three groups: Sham-laparotomy (Sham) 7 days post-surgical survival time]; 50\% partial hepatectomy (PH); 70\% PH PH groups with 1, 3, or 7 days post-surgical survival times]. Post-surgical severity assessment was performed via several multimodal assessment tools: I) model-specific score sheet focusing on body weight, general condition, spontaneous behavior, and the animals’ willingness to move as well as on wound healing; II) Open Field tests evaluating the total distance and velocity an animal moved within 10 minutes and its rearing behavior during the test; III) telemetric data analyzing heart rate and blood pressure; and IV) analysis of blood (AST, ALT, and hemogram) and fecal samples (fecal corticosterone metabolites). Significant differences among the experimental groups and models were observed. We demonstrated that the Open Field test can detect significant changes in severity levels. Sham-laparotomy and removal of 50\% of the liver mass were associated with comparable severity (mild–moderate); the severity parameters returned to baseline levels within seven days. Removal of 70\% of the liver tissue seemed to be associated with a moderate severity grade and entailed a longer recovery period (>7 days) for complete regeneration. We recommend the use of Open Field tests as part of multimodal objective severity assessment.},

Several recommendations on the use of local anesthesia exist, but systematic studies on their efficacy and side effects are lacking. In the present study, male and female C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a sham vasectomy or a sham embryo transfer, respectively. We tested whether a mixture of subcutaneously injected Lidocaine and Bupivacaine in combination with systemic Paracetamol applied via drinking water results in superior pain relief when compared to treatment with local anesthesia or Paracetamol alone. We applied a combination of methods to assess behavioral, emotional, and physiological changes indicative of pain. Voluntary Paracetamol intake via drinking water reached the target dosage of 200 mg/kg in most animals. Local anesthesia did not lead to obvious side effects such as irregular wound healing or systemic disorders. No relevant sex differences were detected in our study. Sevoflurane anesthesia and surgery affected physiological and behavioral measurements. Surprisingly, Paracetamol treatment alone significantly increased the Mouse Grimace Scale. Taken together, mice treated with a combination of local anesthesia and systemic analgesia did not show fewer signs of post-surgical pain or improved recovery compared to animals treated with either local anesthesia or Paracetamol.},

	abstract={Abstract Systematic reviews with meta-analyses are powerful tools that can answer research questions based on data from published studies. Ideally, all relevant data is directly available in the text or tables, but often it is only presented in graphs. In those cases, the data can be extracted from graphs, but this potentially introduces errors. Here, we investigate to what extent the extracted outcome and error values differ from the original data and if these differences could affect the results of a meta-analysis. Six extractors extracted 36 outcome values and corresponding errors from 22 articles. Differences between extractors were compared using overall concordance correlation coefficients (OCCC), differences between the original and extracted data were compared using concordance correlation coefficients (CCC). To test the possible influence on meta-analyses, random-effects meta-analyses on mean difference comparing original and extracted data were performed. The OCCCs and CCCs were high for both outcome values and errors, CCCs were >0.99 for the outcome and >0.92 for errors. The meta-analyses showed that the overall effect on outcome was very small (median: 0.025, interquartile range: 0.016?0.046). Therefore, data extraction from graphs is a good method to harvest data if it is not provided in the text or tables, and the original authors cannot provide the data.},

	abstract={Objective Ethical decisions about an allowance for animal experiments need to be based on scientifically sound information about the burden and distress associated with the experimental procedure and models. Thereby, species differences need to be considered for recommendations regarding evidence-based severity assessment and refinement measures. Methods A comprehensive analysis of behavioral patterns and corticosterone or its metabolites in serum and feces was completed in kindled mice. The impact of kindling via two different stimulation sites in the amygdala and hippocampus was determined. Data were compared to those from naive and electrode-implanted groups. Results Amygdala and hippocampus kindled mice exhibited comparable behavioral patterns with increased activity in the open field, reduced anxiety-associated behavior in the elevated-plus maze, and increased anhedonia-associated behavior in the saccharin preference test. In addition, repeated stimulation of the hippocampus caused a reduction in burrowing behavior and an increase in active social interaction. Levels of corticosterone and its metabolites were not altered in serum or feces, respectively. A comparison of mouse data with findings from amygdala kindled rats confirmed pronounced species differences in behavioral patterns associated with the kindling process. Significance Taken together the findings suggest a severity classification for the mouse kindling paradigms as moderate regardless of the stimulation site. The outcome of the species comparison provides valuable guidance for species selection for studies exploring behavioral comorbidities. In this context, it is emphasized that the mouse kindling paradigms seem to be well suited for studies exploring the link between ictal events and network alterations on the one hand, and hyperactivity and anhedonia-associated behavior on the other hand. Moreover, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the impact of therapeutic interventions on these behavioral alterations can be studied in these paradigms providing guidance for the clinical management of respective psychiatric comorbidities in patients.},

In primary ALL samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, venetoclax and inotuzumab ozogamicin cooperated and synergized in combination with dexamethasone in vitro in all tested samples of ALL. In murine PDX models, inotuzumab ozogamicin, but not venetoclax, induced complete remission in a dose-dependent manner but constantly failed to achieve relapse-free survival. In contrast, combination therapy with venetoclax, dexamethasone, and inotuzumab ozogamicin induced long-term leukemia-free survival and treatment-free survival in all 3 ALL-PDX models tested.

	abstract={Background and Purpose Constipation and intestinal obstructive episodes are major health problems in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Three FDA-approved drugs against constipation-prone irritable bowel syndrome were tested for their ability to increase luminal fluidity and alkalinity in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) null (cftr?/?) and F508del mutant (F508delmut/mut) murine intestine. Experimental Approach Guanylate cyclase C agonist linaclotide, PGE1 analogue lubiprostone and intestine-specific NHE3 inhibitor tenapanor were perfused through a ~3 cm jejunal, proximal or mid-distal colonic segment in anaesthetized cftr?/?, F508delmut/mut and WT mice. Net fluid balance was determined gravimetrically and alkaline output by pH-stat back titration. Key Results Basal jejunal fluid absorptive rates were significantly higher and basal HCO3? output was significantly lower in cftr?/? and F508delmut/mut compared to WT mice. In cftr?/? and F508delmut/mut mice, all three drugs significantly inhibited the fluid absorptive rate and increased alkaline output in the jejunum and tenapanor and lubiprostone, but not linaclotide, in the colon. After tenapanor pre-incubation, linaclotide elicited a robust fluid secretory response in WT jejunum, while no further change in absorptive rates was observed in cftr?/? and F508delmut/mut jejunum, suggesting that the increase in gut fluidity and alkalinity by linaclotide in CF gut is mediated via NHE3 inhibition. Lubiprostone also inhibited fluid absorption in cftr?/? and F508delmut/mut jejunum via NHE3 inhibition but had a residual NHE3-independent effect. Conclusion and Implications Linaclotide, lubiprostone and tenapanor reduced fluid absorption and increased alkaline output in the CF gut. Their application may ameliorate constipation and reduce obstructive episodes in CF patients.},

	abstract={Severity assessment for experiments conducted with laboratory animals is still based mainly on subjective evaluations; evidence-based methods are scarce. Objective measures, amongst which determination of the concentrations of stress hormones, can be used to aid severity assessment. Short-term increases in glucocorticoid concentrations generally reflect healthy responses to stressors, but prolonged increases may indicate impaired welfare. As mice are the most commonly used laboratory animal species, we performed a systematic mapping review of corticosterone measurements in Mus musculus, to provide a full overview of specimen types (e.g. blood, urine, hair, saliva, and milk) and analysis techniques. In this publication, we share our protocol and search strategy, and our rationale for performing this systematic analysis to advance severity assessment. So far, we have screened 13,520 references, and included 5337 on primary studies with measurements of endogenous corticosterone in M. musculus. Data extraction is currently in progress. When finished, this mapping review will be a valuable resource for scientists interested in corticosterone measurements to aid severity assessment. We plan to present the data in a publication and a searchable database, which will allow for even easier retrieval of the relevant literature. These resources will aid implementation of objective measures into severity assessment.},

	journal={Frontiers in Neuroscience},
	volume={14},
	abstract={In animal experimentation, welfare and severity assessments of all procedures applied to animals are necessary to meet legal and ethical requirements, as well as public interests. So far, the methods suggested for this purpose are time consuming and personnel intensive. Also, evidence-based biostatistical methods for this purpose are still rare. We here tested whether the classification of heart rate (HR) and activity (Act) data monitored by telemetry in the home cage by unsupervised k-means-based class-labeling and subsequent Support Vector Machine (SVM) analysis allows severity assessment and grading of experimental procedures of different domains, including surgery, injection, behavioral testing, and routine handling for maintenance. Telemetric devices were subcutaneously implanted in young adult male Crl:CD(SD) and BDIX/UImHanZtm rats. After recovery, rats were randomly subjected to different experimental procedures, i.e., handling and cage change as routine maintenance, Rat Grimace Scale, burrowing, and social interaction for welfare assessment, as well as repeated subcutaneous injections. Thereafter, rats were either intracranially implanted with electrodes or injected with tumor cells. Directly after each procedure, HR and Act were monitored by telemetry in the home cage for 4 h. Application of k-means and SVM algorithms on the obtained data sets from baseline (as no stress), cage change (exploratory Act), and intracranial surgery (as burden) measurements computed three classes described as low HR/low Act, high HR/high Act, and high HR/low Act, respectively. Validation of the SVM model by entering data from all procedures confirmed the allocation to the high HR/low Act class (burden) after surgery, which lasted longer after subcutaneous transmitter implantation than after intracranial surgery. The majority of data points from repeated injections, behavioral testing, and maintenance handling were allocated to the low HR/low Act and high HR/high Act classes. Overall, the SVM model based on HR and Act data monitored in home cage after procedures may be useful for the classification and grading of experimental procedures of different domains.},

	abstract={In order to foster animal welfare as well as high quality of research, many countries regulate by law that the severity of animal experiments must be evaluated and considered when performing biomedical research. It is well accepted that multiple parameters rather than a single readout parameter should be applied to describe animal distress or suffering. However, since the performance of readout parameters for animal distress is rarely defined and methods for multivariate analysis have only in rare cases been used, it is not known which methodology is most appropriate to define animal distress. This study used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to quantify the performance of burrowing activity, body weight change and a distress score of mice after induction of liver damage by bile duct ligation or carbon tetrachloride. In addition, Support Vector Machine classification was used to compare the distress of these mouse models. This approach demonstrated that bile duct ligation causes much more distress than carbon tetrachloride-induced liver damage. This study, therefore, provides a prototype how to compare two animal models by considering several readout parameters. In the future these or similar methods for multivariate analysis will be necessary, when assessing and comparing the severity of animal models.},

	journal={PLOS ONE},
	volume={15},
	number={10},
	pages={e0240439},
	abstract={Early life stress compromises brain development and can contribute to the development of mental illnesses. A common animal model used to study different facets of psychiatric disorders is social isolation from early life on. In rats, this isolation can induce long-lasting alterations in molecular expression and in behavior. Since social isolation models severe psychiatric symptoms, it is to be expected that it affects the overall wellbeing of the animals. As also promoted by the 3Rs principle, though, it is pivotal to decrease the burden of laboratory animals by limiting the number of subjects (reduce, replace) and by improving the animals’ wellbeing (refine). The aim of this study was therefore to test possible refinement strategies such as resocialization and mere adult social isolation. We examined whether the alternatives still triggered the necessary phenotype while minimizing the stress load on the animals. Interestingly, we did not find reduced wellbeing-associated burrowing performance in isolated rats. The hyperactive phenotype seen in socially isolated animals was observed for rats undergoing the adult-only isolation, but resocializing ameliorated the locomotor abnormality. Isolation strongly affected markers of neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex independent of timing: mRNA levels of Arc, Bdnf and the pool of Bdnf transcripts with the 3’ long UTR were reduced in all groups. Bdnf splice variant IV expression was reduced in lifelong-isolated animals. Some of these deficits normalized after resocialization; likewise, exon VI Bdnf mRNA levels were reduced only in animals persistently isolated. Conversely, social deprivation did not affect the expression of Gad67 and Pvb, two GABAergic markers, whereas changes occurred in the expression of dopamine d1 and d2 receptors. As adult isolation was sufficient to trigger the hyperactive phenotype and impaired neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex, it could be a candidate for a refinement strategy for certain research questions. To fully grade the severity of post-weaning social isolation and the alternatives, adult isolation and resocialization, a more profound and multimodal assessment approach is necessary.},

	abstract={The Directive 2010/63 EU requires classifying burden and severity in all procedures using laboratory animals. This study evaluated the severity of liver fibrosis induction by intraperitoneal carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) injections in mice. 29 male C57BL/6N mice were treated three times per week for 4 weeks with an intraperitoneal injection (50 µl) of either 0.6 ml/kg body weight CCl4-vehicle solution, germ oil (vehicle-control) or handling only. Severity assessment was performed using serum analysis, behavioral tests (open field test, rotarod, burrowing and nesting behavior), fecal corticosterone metabolite (FCM) measurement, and survival. The most significant group differences were noticed in the second week of treatment when the highest AST (1463 ± 1404 vs. 123.8 ± 93 U/L, p < 0.0001) and nesting values were measured. In addition, respective animals showed lower moving distances (4622 ± 1577 vs. 6157 ± 2060 cm, p < 0.01) and velocity in the Open field, identified as main factors in principal component analysis (PCA). Overall, a 50\% survival rate was observed within the treatment group, in which the open field performance was a good tracer parameter for survival. In summary, this study demonstrates the feasibility of assessing severity in mice using behavioral tests and highlight the open field test as a possible threshold parameter for risk assessment of mortality.},

	abstract={Abstract In order to combine high-quality research with minimal harm to animals, a prospective severity assessment for animal experiments is legally required in many countries. In addition, an assessment of the evidence-based severity level might allow realistic harm?benefit analysis and the appraisal of refinement methods. However, only a few examples describe the distress of animals by simple, cost-efficient, and noninvasive methods. We, therefore, evaluated the severity of an orthotopic mouse model for pancreatic cancer using C57BL/6J mice when pursuing two different chemotherapies. We assessed fecal corticosterone metabolites, body weight, distress score, and burrowing, as well as nesting activity. Moreover, we established a multifactorial model using multivariate logistic regression to describe animal distress. This multifactorial analysis revealed that metformin + galloflavin treatment caused higher distress than metformin + α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate therapy. Similar results were obtained by using the best cutoff calculated by Youden's J index when using only single parameters, such as burrowing activity or fecal corticosterone metabolite concentration. Thus, the present study revealed that single readout parameters, as well as multivariate analysis, can help to assess the severity of animal experiments and detect side effects of therapies.},

	abstract={Animal models in psychiatric research are indispensable for insights into mechanisms of behaviour and mental disorders. Distress is an important aetiological factor in psychiatric diseases, especially depression, and is often used to mimic the human condition. Modern bioethics requires balancing scientific progress with animal welfare concerns. Therefore, scientifically based severity assessment of procedures is a prerequisite for choosing the least compromising paradigm according to the 3Rs principle. Evidence-based severity assessment in psychiatric animal models is scarce, particularly in depression research.

Exposure to the paradigm evoked a transient elevation of corticosterone, but neither affected body weight, nesting or burrowing behaviour.

	abstract={Reduction of animal suffering during in vivo experiments is usually ensured by continuously monitoring the health status using a score sheet and by applying humane endpoints. However, most studies do not evaluate the plausibility of score sheets and do not attempt to reduce the suffering of animals by determining earlier and, therefore, more humane endpoints. The present study uses data from BALB/cANCrl mice after bile duct ligation to retrospectively analyze which score sheet criteria are informative to determine humane endpoints. The performance of each single as well as com­binations of multiple animal welfare parameters was analyzed by a Cox proportional-hazards model followed by Harrell’s concordance index. The addition of behavioral parameters, such as burrowing activity, helped to define a more humane early endpoint for euthanizing these animals. Using this approach, we determined that a body weight loss of 10-20\% combined with a reduction of burrowing activity by more than 79.4\% was able to predict that these animals would die within two days. Thus, this approach successfully determined an earlier humane endpoint and will reduce the suffering of animals in future experiments. Application of such an approach or similar methods can contribute to the refinement of various animal experiments.},

	journal={Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience},
	volume={12},
	abstract={Autoreactive T cells that infiltrate into the central nervous system (CNS) are believed to have a significant role in mediating the pathology of neuroinflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis. Their interaction with microglia and astrocytes in the CNS is crucial for the regulation of neuroinflammatory processes. Our previous work demonstrated that effectors secreted by Th1 and Th17 cells have different capacities to influence the phenotype and function of glial cells. We have shown that Th1-derived effectors altered the phenotype and function of both microglia and astrocytes whereas Th17-derived effectors induced direct effects only on astrocytes but not on microglia. Here we investigated if effector molecules associated with IFN-γ producing Th1 cells induced different gene expression profiles in microglia and astrocytes. We performed a microarray analysis of RNA isolated from microglia and astrocytes treated with medium and Th-derived culture supernatants and compared the gene expression data. By using the criteria of 2-fold change and a false discovery rate of 0.01 (corrected p < 0.01), we demonstrated that a total of 2,106 and 1,594 genes were differentially regulated in microglia and astrocytes, respectively, in response to Th1-derived factors. We observed that Th1-derived effectors induce distinct transcriptional changes in microglia and astrocytes in addition to commonly regulated transcripts. These distinct transcriptional changes regulate peculiar physiological functions, and this knowledge can help to better understand T cell mediated neuropathologies.},

	abstract={Author summary Animal-based biomedical research is often accompanied by experience of discomfort or pain by the animal. Recognition of disturbed animal welfare is mandatory, and the classification and assessment of its severity is a crucial part of the legislative framework in the European Union (EU). In the present study, we analysed voluntary wheel running (VWR) behaviour as a measure of compromised welfare in a mouse colitis model. Unsupervised mathematical clustering of clinical and VWR data enabled us to allocate and classify severity levels. This cluster model was verified using VWR data from a restraint stress model and allowed us to uncover the impact of routine experimental procedures on these mice. We propose that clustering of VWR behaviour provides a useful method for assessing the severity level of experimental procedures conducted on mice.},

	journal={Frontiers in Immunology},
	volume={9},
	abstract={Tissue macrophages are important components of tissue homeostasis and inflammatory pathologies. In the peritoneal cavity, resident macrophages interact with a variety of immune cells and can exhibit broad range of phenotypes and functions. Forkhead-box-P3 (FOXP3)+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an indispensable role in maintaining immunological tolerance, yet whether, and how the pathological condition that results from the lack of functional Tregs affects peritoneal macrophages (PM) is largely unknown. We used FOXP3-deficient scurfy (Sf) mice to investigate PM behavior in terms of the missing crosstalk with Tregs. Here, we report that Treg deficiency induced a marked increase in PM numbers, which was reversed after adoptive transfer of CD4+ T cells or neutralization of macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Ex vivo assays demonstrated a pro-inflammatory state of PM from Sf mice and signs of excessive activation and exhaustion. In-depth immunophenotyping of Sf PM using single-cell chipcytometry and transcriptome analysis revealed upregulation of molecules involved in the initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses. Moreover, upon transfer to non-inflammatory environment or after injection of CD4+ T cells, PM from Sf mice reprogramed their functional phenotype, indicating remarkable plasticity. Interestingly, frequencies, and immune polarization of large and small PM subsets were dramatically changed in the FOXP3-deficient mice, suggesting distinct origin and specialized function of these subsets in inflammatory conditions. Our findings demonstrate the significant impact of Tregs in shaping PM identity and dynamics. A better understanding of PM function in the Sf mouse model may have clinical implication for the treatment of immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome, and other forms of immune-mediated enteropathies.},

	journal={PLOS ONE},
	volume={12},
	number={4},
	pages={e0175839},
	abstract={The EU Directive 2010/63/EU changed the requirements regarding the use of laboratory animals and raised important issues related to assessing the severity of all procedures undertaken on laboratory animals. However, quantifiable parameters to assess severity are rare, and improved assessment strategies need to be developed. Hence, a Sheep Grimace Scale (SGS) was herein established by observing and interpreting sheep facial expressions as a consequence of pain and distress following unilateral tibia osteotomy. The animals were clinically investigated and scored five days before surgery and at 1, 3, 7, 10, 14 and 17 days afterwards. Additionally, cortisol levels in the saliva of the sheep were determined at the respective time points. For the SGS, video recording was performed, and pictures of the sheep were randomized and scored by blinded observers. Osteotomy in sheep resulted in an increased clinical severity score from days 1 to 17 post-surgery and elevated salivary cortisol levels one day post-surgery. An analysis of facial expressions revealed a significantly increased SGS on the day of surgery until day 3 post-surgery; this elevated level was sustained until day 17. Clinical severity and SGS scores correlated positively with a Pearson´s correlation coefficient of 0.47. Further investigations regarding the applicability of the SGS revealed a high inter-observer reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.92 and an accuracy of 68.2\%. In conclusion, the SGS represents a valuable approach for severity assessment that may help support and refine a widely used welfare assessment for sheep during experimental procedures, thereby meeting legislation requirements and minimizing the occurrence of unrecognized distress in animal experimentation.},

	pages={102-115},
	abstract={RNA interference (RNAi) and CRISPR-Cas9-based screening systems have emerged as powerful and complementary tools to unravel genetic dependencies through systematic gain- and loss-of-function studies. In recent years, a series of technical advances helped to enhance the performance of virally delivered RNAi. For instance, the incorporation of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) into endogenous microRNA contexts (shRNAmiRs) allows the use of Tet-regulated promoters for synchronous onset of gene knockdown and precise interrogation of gene dosage effects. However, remaining challenges include lack of efficient cloning strategies, inconsistent knockdown potencies and leaky expression. Here, we present a simple, one-step cloning approach for rapid and efficient cloning of miR-30 shRNAmiR libraries. We combined a human miR-30 backbone retaining native flanking sequences with an optimized all-in-one lentiviral vector system for conditional RNAi to generate a versatile toolbox characterized by higher doxycycline sensitivity, reduced leakiness and enhanced titer. Furthermore, refinement of existing shRNA design rules resulted in substantially improved prediction of powerful shRNAs. Our approach was validated by accurate quantification of the knockdown potency of over 250 single shRNAmiRs. To facilitate access and use by the scientific community, an online tool was developed for the automated design of refined shRNA-coding oligonucleotides ready for cloning into our system.},

	abstract={Background Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram-negative bacterium that is ubiquitously present in the aerobic biosphere. As an antibiotic-resistant facultative pathogen, it is a major cause of hospital-acquired infections. Its rapid and accurate identification is crucial in clinical and therapeutic environments. Methods In a large-scale MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based screen of the Harvard transposon insertion mutant library of P. aeruginosa strain PA14, intact-cell proteome profile spectra of 5547 PA14 transposon mutants exhibiting a plethora of different phenotypes were acquired and analyzed. Results Of all P. aeruginosa PA14 mutant profiles 99.7\% were correctly identified as P. aeruginosa with the Biotyper software on the species level. On the strain level, 99.99\% of the profiles were mapped to five different individual P. aeruginosa Biotyper database entries. A principal component analysis-based approach was used to determine the most important discriminatory mass features between these Biotyper groups. Although technical replicas were consistently categorized to specific Biotyper groups in 94.2\% of the mutant profiles, biological replicas were not, indicating that the distinct proteotypes are affected by growth conditions. Conclusions The PA14 mutant profile collection presented here constitutes the largest coherent P. aeruginosa MALDI-TOF spectral dataset publicly available today. Transposon insertions in thousands of different P. aeruginosa genes did not affect species identification from MALDI-TOF mass spectra, clearly demonstrating the robustness of the approach. However, the assignment of the individual spectra to sub-groups proved to be non-consistent in biological replicas, indicating that the differentiation between biotyper groups in this nosocomial pathogen is unassured.},
