Animals cannot verbally express their distress, forcing researchers to rely on observable parameters such as body weight changes, activity levels, clinical scores, and physiological markers. However, these parameters are often analyzed in isolation, making it difficult to compare severity across different experimental models or studies.\n\nHow do we objectively compare the severity of a colitis model with that of a tumor model? Traditional approaches rely heavily on subjective expert judgment, which can introduce bias and inconsistency.\n\n## Enter RELSA: Relative Severity Assessment\n\nThe **RELSA (Relative Severity Assessment)** algorithm addresses this challenge by combining multiple welfare-relevant variables into a single, quantitative composite score. Rather than evaluating parameters independently, RELSA fuses multidimensional input signals to provide a holistic severity assessment that can be compared across individual animals, time points, and even different animal models.\n\n### Key Advantages for the 3R Community\n\n1. **Objectivity**: RELSA reduces human bias by using data-driven normalization and scoring\n2. **Comparability**: Enables direct comparison of severity between different experimental procedures and models\n3. **Evidence-based refinement**: Provides quantitative evidence for refining experimental protocols\n4. **Regulatory support**: Offers objective documentation for animal experiment applications\n\n## How RELSA Works\n\nThe RELSA workflow consists of four main steps:\n\n### 1. Normalization\n\nRaw experimental data (e.g., body weight, burrowing activity, clinical scores) are normalized to ensure all variables contribute equally to the final score, regardless of their original scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(RELSA)\n\n# Normalize your data\nnormalized_data <- relsa_norm(\n  data = your_data,\n  normthese = c(\"bw\", \"burrough\", \"clinical_score\"),\n  turnalievet = c(\"burrough\")\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 2. Baseline Establishment\n\nBaseline values are calculated from a reference period (typically pre-experimental days) to establish what \"normal\" looks like for each variable.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate baselines\nbaselines <- relsa_baselines(\n  data = normalized_data,\n  bession = c(-3, -2, -1)\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 3. Severity Level Classification\n\nNormalized values are categorized into severity levels, allowing for meaningful interpretation of deviations from baseline.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Assign severity levels\nlevels <- relsa_levels(\n  data = normalized_data,\n  mybaselines = baselines,\n  k = 4\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### 4. RELSA Score Calculation\n\nThe final RELSA score is computed as a root mean square (RMS) of all normalized variables, providing a single value that represents overall severity.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate RELSA score\nrelsa_score <- relsa(\n  data = normalized_data,\n  mybaselines = baselines\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Comparing Severity Across Models\n\nOne of RELSA's most powerful applications is the ability to compare severity across different animal models using a common reference set. By normalizing against a defined reference (e.g., a transmitter implantation procedure), researchers can objectively rank the severity of different experimental procedures.\n\nFor example, studies using RELSA have shown severity rankings such as:\n\n> CCl4 intoxication < Pancreatic tumor ≈ Pancreatitis < Bile duct ligation\n\nThis type of quantitative comparison was previously impossible with traditional subjective scoring methods.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThe RELSA package is available on GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Install from GitHub\ndevtools::install_github(\"mytalbot/RELSA\")\n\nlibrary(RELSA)\n```\n:::\n\n\nFor detailed tutorials and vignettes, visit the [RELSA documentation](https://talbotsr.com/RELSA/).\n\n## Conclusion\n\nRELSA represents a significant step forward in evidence-based severity assessment for laboratory animal research. By providing objective, quantitative scores that can be compared across models and studies, it supports the 3Rs principles—particularly **Refinement**—by enabling data-driven decisions about experimental protocols and humane endpoints.\n\n## References\n\nTalbot SR, Struve B, Wassermann L, et al.
