## About Me

I am a biochemist, data scientist, and leader of the [Preclinical Data Science](https://www.mhh.de/talbot) group at the Institute for Laboratory Animal Science at Hannover Medical School (MHH), where I specialise in the intersection of artificial intelligence, statistics, and translational laboratory animal research.

My research focuses on developing data-science-driven solutions for quantitative severity assessment in animal experiments. A major achievement has been the RELSA (Relative Severity Assessment) score, which has also been adapted for pediatric care as the Patient Vital Score (PVS). I apply AI and statistical methods to support regulatory processes, experimental design, and the 3Rs principles in preclinical research.

## Research Interests

- **Severity Assessment**: Multidimensional scoring algorithms (e.g., RELSA) for objective burden quantification
- **AI in Regulatory Science**: LLM-assisted evaluation and optimization of animal experiment applications
- **Clinical Translation**: From animal welfare scores to human ICU monitoring (Patient Vital Status)
- **Experimental Design**: Bayesian sample size planning and multi-center reproducibility validation
- **3Rs & Alternative Methods**: Data-driven reduction strategies and organoid model validation

## Current Position

**Group Leader, Preclinical Data Science**
*Institute of Laboratory Animal Science*
Hannover Medical School (MHH)
Hannover, Germany
